    <h4>The Fisherman And The Little Fish</h4>
     <p>




A poor Fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fry. The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said:
<br><br>
"Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal."
<br><br>
But the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.
<br><br>
"How foolish I should be," he said, "to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all."
<br><br><i>
A small gain is worth more than a large promise.
